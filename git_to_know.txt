#published branch on remote server -> start working on that topic too
git checkout --track origin/dev
#This creates a new local branch with the same name as the remote one-
#and directly establishes a tracking connection between the two

#delete remote branch
git push origin --delete <branchName>

#to remove the file from the repo and not delete it from the local file system use:
git rm --cached file.txt
